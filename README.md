# Chromatic-light-theme

Theme for [Brackets.io](http://brackets.io), based on Chromium dev tools syntax highlight. Over the years, during countless debugging sessions, I learned reading code like so I decided to follow this trail.

## Supported filetypes

* JavaScript (*.js)
* ClojureScript (*.clj, *cljs)
* CSS (*.css)
* Less (*.less)
* HTML (*.html)
* Markdown (*.md)

## Notes

* JavaScript has two changes, comparing to Chromium, that I found helpful: keywords (like `function` or `return`) are bolded and object properties are in italics.
* ClojureScript files syntax highlith is not supported natively by Chromium so this is somewhat autheurâ€™s approach but I worked a bit with this language and found it working for me.
